							<strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong>
									<p>
							                  By downloading or using the app, these terms will
							                  automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
							                  that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
							                  allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
							                  our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
							                  extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
							                  to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
							                  versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
							                  database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
							                  to it, still belong to Jana Jansen.
							                </p> <p>
							                  Jana Jansen is committed to ensuring that the app is
							                  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
							                  reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
							                  its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
							                  charge you for the app or its services without making it very
							                  clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
							                </p> <p>
							                  The Master Mind app stores and processes personal data that
							                  you have provided to us, to provide my
							                  Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
							                  access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
							                  not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
							                  removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
							                  official operating system of your device. It could make your
							                  phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
							                  compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
							                  that the Master Mind app won’t work properly or at all.
							                </p> <div><p>
							                    The app does use third-party services that declare their
							                    Terms and Conditions.
							                  </p> <p>
							                    Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service

							                  You should be aware that there are certain things that
							                  Jana Jansen will not take responsibility for. Certain
							                  functions of the app will require the app to have an active
							                  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
							                  by your mobile network provider, but Jana Jansen
							                  cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
							                  functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
							                  have any of your data allowance left.
							                </p> <p></p> <p>
							                  If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
							                  should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
							                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
							                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
							                  the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
							                  other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
							                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
							                  charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
							                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
							                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
							                  using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
							                  received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
							                </p> <p>
							                  Along the same lines, Jana Jansen cannot always take
							                  responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
							                  make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
							                  battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
							                  Jana Jansen cannot accept responsibility.
							                </p> <p>
							                  With respect to Jana Jansen’s responsibility for your
							                  use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
							                  bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
							                  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
							                  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
							                  to you. Jana Jansen accepts no liability for any
							                  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
							                  relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
							                </p> <p>
							                  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
							                  currently available on Android – the requirements for the
							                  system(and for any additional systems we
							                  decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
							                  and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
							                  using the app. Jana Jansen does not promise that it
							                  will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
							                  and/or works with the Android version that you have
							                  installed on your device. However, you promise to always
							                  accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
							                  also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
							                  it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
							                  Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
							                  rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
							                  (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
							                  from your device.
							                </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
							                  I may update our Terms and Conditions
							                  from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
							                  periodically for any changes. I will
							                  notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
							                  Conditions on this page.
							                </p> <p>
							                  These terms and conditions are effective as of 2022-04-27
